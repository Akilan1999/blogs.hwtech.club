My Coding History
--
Right now, I am a computer Science student who learnt a lot of languages and coded many programs. But all this started years back, when i first wrote my Hello World! program in Java in my school days. That's when it all started off. My First programming langiage was Java and believed that it was the best programming language that was out there and when i came to university, that perspective changed... for the the better.

As of now, i have learnt over 14 Programming languages which includes declarative,imperative and web Programming as well. Database management systems is also a key learning factor while learning programming languages.

Pre-Basics of coding
--
Well, before learning the basics of coding, we all need to understand in what to code and why with emphasis on the latter. There are thousands of programming languages out there and choosing to learn one language to begin with is a hard task. That comes to the second question of why.
Well,I believe that if you start learning a more Non-Anstracted code language like C and Java, it'll help you understand how recent and more professional code languages like Python work behind the scenes.

Keeping that in mind, i would like to give you some languages to start working on and learning the basics of the language.Remember, Learning WHY is more important than WHAT the code does. 

- C      (Best to start with)
- Java   (Good option as well)
- C++

What to start with?
--
Every language has it's own syntax and it's own concept, but the basics remain the same. You have to first understand these basic concepts:
1. [Classes and Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeP1CztNMdo&feature=emb_logo)
2. [Encapsulation and Inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXHOrKEjHo0)
3. [Polymorphism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmdgVatPL9k)

These concepts make the building blocks of [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoL6WvCARJY).Only after you are thorough with these topics, you should have your *hands on coding!!*.
