My Coding History
--
Right now, I am a computer Science student who learnt a lot of languages and coded many programs. But all this started years back, when i first wrote my Hello World! program in Java in my school days. That's when it all started off. My First programming langiage was Java and believed that it was the best programming language that was out there and when i came to university, that perspective changed... for the the better.

As of now, i have learnt over 14 Programming languages which includes declarative,imperative and web Programming as well. Database management systems is also a key learning factor while learning programming languages.

Well, before learning the basics of coding, we all need to understand in what to code and why with emphasis on the latter. There are thousands of programming languages out there and choosing to learn one language to begin with is a hard task. That comes to the second question of why.
