The title is not entirely accurate, obviously because there is the iPhone 11 which has only 2 cam's and missing the telephoto lens. Well, the cheaper variant is assumed to have limited features, but the American tech supergiant has not compromised on any major hardware or software aspect of this phone which is commendable.The iPhone 11 comes in 3 different variants, the iPhone 11,iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.

The major change made to this phone and it's predecessor is the new camera lens. Like many other competetors, Apple also designed their first 3-cam smartphone.

The iPhone 11 has the wide and ultra wide angle cams and not the telephoto lens. It also comes with the iconic Night Mode which is automatically switched to when low light is detected.
